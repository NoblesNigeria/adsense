        <h2>Oil Palm Production and Establishment</h2>
        <p>Oil palm {Elaesis guineensis} industry is one high profit yielding
business in Nigeria, contributing greatly to the economy of the
country, provide employment and foreign exchange commodity. The
products from oil palm such as the crude oil, palm kernel oil are of
high demand globally for food, cosmetics and other industrial raw
material. The average lifespan of a palm tree is about 80 years and
maintains profitable production throughout this period, this quality
makes oil palm establishment a lifetime investment for investors. It
takes 3-4 years from the time of transplanting to main field for oil
palm to start producing fruits. The average yield per hectare per year
is approximately 3-8 tons of crude oil. There’re some key factors to
consider during palm plantation establishment.</p>
        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>Nigeria was once the largest producer of palm oil in the world in the
1960s, producing about 43% of the world’s total production. This
was lost due to a shift in the policies toward petroleum. Today
Nigeria is the fifth largest global producers contributing about 2% of
world’s total production. Despite its potentials in the sector the
country still imports significant quantity to meet local needs.</p>
        <h2>Profitability of oil palm production</h2>
        <p>Oil palm production is one the most profitable and stable
Agricultural business, this is because there is a global demand for
its product for food, cosmetics and industrial raw materials. The
estimated profit margin of oil palm production is as follows</p>

       <h2>Oil Palm Plantation Establishment</h2>
       <p>The basic area of discussion in this article is the plantation
establishment, this the part that do with placing the plant in the
permanent field for growth. Plantation establishment skills is a key
part of a successful oil palm business and as such should be
considered carefully because this part determines the yield of the
plantation throughout the lifetime of each palm trees. The major
factors to consider are as follows</p>
       <p>*Land</p>
       <p>*Climate region</p>
       <p>*Choice of species</p>
       <p>*Plant spacing</p>
       <p>*Plant arrangement orientation</p>
       <p>*Field maintenance</p>
       <h3>Land</h3>
       <p>Oil palm tree grows on a wide range of soil type but does well
in a well-drained loamy soil. Selecting good land is essential
because type of land determines the lifespan and productivity of oil
palm tree. Lands that’re considered agriculturally bad lands should
be avoided.</p>
        <h3>Climate</h3>
        <p>The climate region is another important factor to consider
when establishing oil palm plantations. Some of the climate belt
considered favorable is the guinea savannah and the rain forest
climate zones, in these regions there is adequate rain fall and
sunlight to support the growth and reproduction of oil palm trees.</p>
        <h3>Choice of Species</h3>
        <p>There are various species in oil palm, your choice of species
should be determined by your intended target of oil palm product.
Most time investors target palm oil while others target palm kernel
oil, palm kernel cake and breeding purposes, any of these will
determine the species you should plant. There are three main
species of oil palm, these includes</p>
        <p>*Dura</p>
        <p>*Precifera</p>
        <p>*Tenera</p>
        <h4>Dura</h4>
        <p>This species contains more of kernel products
because of its large seed nature, with fewer quality and slug free red
oil quantity. An investor who wants palm kernel products should
consider planting the Dura species.</p>
        <h4>Precifera</h4>
        <p>This is another species of oil palm, it is most time
seedless and with large quantity of slug which affect the quality and
quantity of the oil, this species is mainly used for breeding
purposes.
</p>
        <p>Tenera</p>
        <p>This species is a hybrid species and is mainly for
commercial palm oil production, it contains quality and large
volume of palm oil quantity.</p>
        <h3>Plant Spacing</h3>
        <p>Basically, oil palm tree does well with appropriate spacing and
plant populations. Planting distance for oil palm tree is nine meters
apart, which is approximately thirty feet. The ideal plant population
per an acre of farmland is sixty oil palm plant stands and that is also
one hundred and fifty oil palm plant stands per hectare of farmland.</p>
        <h3>Plant Arrangement Orientation
</h3>
        <p>This is the technical part of plantation establishment that
requires a professional to handle the plant placement in the main or
permanent field for grow out. A proper planting orientation will allow
adequate sunlight and aeration in the plantation which will support
the survival of every flower bud and fruit bud produced by the oil
palm tree making it possible to set fruits round the treetop. Plant
arrangement orientation is done in such a way that during planting,
the baseline is taken in a south north direction, such that each plant
does not shadow the next plant in the field, that’s plant receives
their own sunlight without obstructions, in other to be sure you got it
right the baseline view should form a right angle with the shadow of
the pegs in the baseline. This part of the plantation establishment is
very important and should be taken into absolute consideration
during oil palm planting.</p>
        <h3>Field Maintenance</h3>
        <p>These activities include every practice to ensure that the
immediate environment of the plant is conducive enough for
the plant to grow healthily, they are weed control, pruning, ring
weeding, fertilizer application.</p>

    <h3>Conclusions
</h3>
        <p>Oil palm production industry can provide an excellent and
permanent financial stability, this is because the profit margin in oil
palm production is very high, it’s one of the business one can retire
to or start up life with, though it’s slightly capital intense but very
safe and reliable business you can invest in and be secured.</p>
