        <h2>Oil Palm Production and Establishment</h2>
        <p>Oil palm {Elaesis guineensis} industry is one high profit yielding

products from oil palm such as the crude oil, palm kernel oil are of
high demand globally for food, cosmetics and other industrial raw
material. The average lifespan of a palm tree is about 80 years and
maintains profitable production throughout this period, this quality
makes oil palm establishment a lifetime investment for investors. It
takes 3-4 years from the time of transplanting to main field for oil
palm to start producing fruits. The average yield per hectare per year
is approximately 3-8 tons of crude oil. There’re some key factors to
consider during palm plantation establishment.</p>
        <h2>Historical Background</h2>
        <p>Nigeria was once the largest producer of palm oil in the world in the
1960s, producing about 43% of the world’s total production. This
was lost due to a shift in the policies toward petroleum. Today
Nigeria is the fifth largest global producers contributing about 2% of
world’s total production. Despite its potentials in the sector the
country still imports significant quantity to meet local needs.</p>
        <h2>Profitability of oil palm production</h2>
        <p>Oil palm production is one the most profitable and stable
Agricultural business, this is because there is a global demand for
